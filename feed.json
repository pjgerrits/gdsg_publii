            "content_html": "<p>This project aims to overcome historiographical and disciplinary limitations in social and economic history, historical geography and urban studies for the Ottoman Empire and the Republic of Türkiye. The chosen long-term Ottoman/Turkish perspective is intended to facilitate comparative approaches so as to overcome the limitations of national historiographies. By extending the analysis up to 2000 the project also challenges the disciplinary divide between economic history, economics and urban studies in research on Türkiye.</p>\n<p>Find out more at <a href=\"https://urbanoccupations.ku.edu.tr\">https://urbanoccupations.ku.edu.tr</a></p>",

GALLANT takes a whole-systems approach. While addressing the city’s key environmental challenges, we will consider the co-benefits and trade-offs for public health, wellbeing and economy. GALLANT aims to deliver the social priorities of the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/\">United Nations (UN)</a> <a href=\"https://sdgs.un.org/goals\">Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</a> while remaining within the planetary boundaries of a 1.5°C world - using doughnut economics as a framework.</p>\n<p>The programme brings together over 50 multidisciplinary researchers with 29 public and private sector partners across the city region. Together we aim not only to bring nature back into the city system, but make meaningful, lasting change that embeds sustainability across major policy decisions and empowers communities as stewards of their local places. GALLANT will work with local partners and communities to transform the city into a thriving place for people and nature. GALLANT will help Glasgow achieve its goal to be carbon neutral by 2030 and accelerate its path to climate resilience.</p>\n<p>Find out more at <a href=\"https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/sustainablesolutions/ourprojects/gallant/\">https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/sustainablesolutions/ourprojects/gallant/ : </a></p>",
