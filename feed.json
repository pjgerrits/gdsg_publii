Cross validation of locational information extracted from textual data and associated images may help to identify inconsistencies between reported accounts, potentially highlighting sources of online misinformation. In this regard, reliable and accurate geolocation of text and image data will play a crucial role in combatting misinformation, and in aiding counter terrorism efforts.</p>\n<p>This project consists of two components – a multi-lingual text-based geoparser and an image-based geotagger. The text-based geoparser aims to use modern natural language processing techniques to identify place names within text and classify those places in terms of their semantic meaning within a sentence. By doing this, we can identify the geographical subject of a news article or social media post, and use the other mentioned place names to help disambiguate potential matches for the identified subject.</p>\n<p>The image based geotagger uses points of interest and spatial features to associate an image with a pair of geographic coordinates. The model uses features such as text and signage, foliage types, and building styles to geolocate images to within a broad region. A more fine-scale geographic prediction can then be made by using spatial features which are identifiable and projectable onto a map, such as building orientations and road layouts.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"690\" height=\"387\" style=\"width: 690px; height: 387px;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QB1iz4Syk_k\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe>\n<div class=\"container mt-5\">\n<div class=\"post\">\n<article>\n<div class=\"caption\">Ana Basiri and Joseph Shingleton discuss their work on defence and security.</div>\n</article>\n</div>\n</div>\n<footer class=\"fixed-bottom\"></footer></figure>\n</article>",

Yet, the data from existing sources such as OpenStreetMap is often incomplete, posing a significant challenge. My research addresses this critical issue by deploying a novel method: using ubiquitous cellular signals as a tool for estimating building heights. The received signal strength (RSS) picked up by ground users from cellular antennas helps to map out a “shadow” area in the vicinity of specific buildings, which implicitly provides essential information that can be used to accurately determine the heights of those buildings. This approach stands out for its efficiency and potential scalability. It could evolve into a crowd-sourced platform, offering a more cost-effective alternative for obtaining accurate urban topographical data. This research not only provides a solution to a persistent data gap but also has wider implications for urban planning, environmental monitoring, and the next wave of autonomous technologies.</p>\n</article>",

He is researching missing data and how spatial information can be used to improve the accuracy of techniques used to replace the missing values. Missing data is a serious issue for all users of data, including those working in biomedical research, climate change, business, financial and economic analytics. It is a particular problem for users of big data and seriously limits the applicability of their models, not least because it can introduce new forms of data bias that may be especially hard to detect and address.</p>\n<p>If missing data is present in a dataset it can results in less accurate analysis results and assessment of uncertainty, even if measures are taken to allow for these omissions. This can seriously affect the value of subsequent data uses and limits the value of big data despite its apparent large scale. Prior to undertaking his PhD Dominick was Chief Data Officer of a multinational corporation and before that Chief Economist of a small investment bank.
